## Overview

The topic of our conversation will center around how to get access to sports data and why you should know your way around the data generated by the sports in which you are interested.

. . .

## About Me

Saiem Gilani - Lead engineer and founder of the SportsDataverse <br><a href='https://twitter.com/saiemgilani' target='blank'><img src="https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/saiemgilani?color=blue&amp;label=%40saiemgilani&amp;logo=twitter&amp;style=for-the-badge" alt="@saiemgilani"/></a> <a href='https://github.com/saiemgilani' target='blank'><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/followers/saiemgilani?color=eee&amp;logo=Github&amp;style=for-the-badge" alt="@saiemgilani"/></a>

### Background

Born and raised a Seminole, I am an FSU alumnus in mathematics and went to graduate school at Georgia Tech for analytics. My general domain of work is machine learning and data science with a current focus on sports.

. . .

## How did you get started? 

I attended the FSU Sports Analytics Summit 2020!

::: columns
::: {.column width="100%"}
I wrote up some of my thoughts and observations on incoming coach Mike Norvell's presentation on a handful of analytics-related topics. This became my first article for [Tomahawk Nation](https://www.tomahawknation.com/), the SBNation blog covering the Seminoles.

## Meeting Good Folks Online

Simultaneously, I started working with the `{cfbscrapR}` package (now archived) to help write analytics driven articles. <br> <br>

I quickly became involved with contributing to my first open-source package, eventually becoming a co-author. I then developed the successor to the package, [`{cfbfastR}`](https://cfbfastR.sportsdataverse.org).

## Then, I had an idea `r emo::ji("light_bulb")`

I had a thought I am sure many of the long-standing members of the sports analytics community has had.

-   *what if getting sports data for analysis was easy?*

-   *what if we worked together to build the data infrastructure for research?*

-   *how much further would we get?*

## The SportsDataverse

::: incremental
-   An organization trying to make the sports data and analytics industry more diverse, inclusive, and accessible by providing high-quality resources for end-users and opportunities for practical code skill development for those that join the effort\
    `r emo::ji("light_bulb")` + `r emo::ji("computer")` + `r emo::ji("chart_increasing")`

-   A set of packages for loading and scraping sports data in R, Python, and Node.js with focus placed on play-by-play data\
    <a href="https://r.sportsdataverse.org/" target="_blank" alt="R"> <img src="media/r-project-icon.svg" alt="R" width="40" height="40"/> </a> + <a href="https://py.sportsdataverse.org/" alt="Saiem's Python Packages" target="_blank"> <img src="media/python-original.svg" alt="python" width="40" height="40"/> </a> + <a href="https://js.sportsdataverse.org" target="_blank"> <img src="media/nodejs.png" alt="nodejs" width="60" height="50"/> </a>
:::

. . .

## The strength of the SportsDataverse

::: incremental
-   A community of developers committed to developing and maintaining open-source sports data packages and pipelines as on-going public utilities\
    `r emo::ji("group")` + `r emo::ji("speech_balloon")` + `r emo::ji("coder")` + `r emo::ji("package")`

-   A set of corresponding data repositories which allow fast loading of the data for users and collectively form one of the largest open-source sports data resources with **over 250Gb of data produced** from the packages I contribute to\
    `r emo::ji("key")` + `r emo::ji("crown")`

Access to loadable SDV-provided data and functions in the [`sportsdataverse`](https://py.sportsdataverse.org/) python module and access to ESPN endpoints. Additional modules include: [`sportypy`](https://sportypy.sportsdataverse.org/), [`collegebaseball`](https://collegebaseball.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [`nwslpy`](https://github.com/nwslR/nwslpy), and [`recruitR-py`](https://github.com/sportsdataverse/recruitR-py/) <br> <br>

Access to ESPN endpoints (among other websites) via the [`sportsdataverse`](https://js.sportsdataverse.org/) node.js module for easy web application development.

## Why use the SportsDataverse? {.smaller}

The first public conversation on the SportsDataverse projects happened at the Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference. The paper I wrote for the conference was selected as the winner for the Data and Software contribution, Open Track for their reproducible research competition.

-   It was built for you enthusiasts and soon-to-be entrants into the field
-   Designed to have consistent package function naming conventions to allow for easy cross-package knowledge transfer
-   

. . .

## Great... but how does this affect me?

#### Well, there is a fairly direct pipeline from...

-   contributing to open-source projects
-   using open-source resources to create your own open-source sports analytics projects and portfolio
-   being an active member of the open-source sports analytics community

#### **...to getting a job in Sports Analytics**

## So, what do you really do?

I make data things work together to create models, reports, and applications for other stakeholders to use in their decision-making (or perhaps for upstream/downstream processes).

::: callout-note
## It's about *knowledge* and not just *code*

Tasks can include:

-   Creating a useful model for player and team evaluation
-   Producing a nightly report of games and player boxscores using internal metrics and methods
-   Developing API's and database methods for evolving data service provider offerings
-   ... doing it better, communicating it better
